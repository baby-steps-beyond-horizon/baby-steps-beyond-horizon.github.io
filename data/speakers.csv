Francesco,Bonsante,https://www.google.com,University of Pavia,Italy,Rigidity of convex surfaces in space-forms,"The main question we will address in the talk is whether the first fundamental form of a compact convex surface in Euclidea 3-dim space determines the shape of the surface. We will in particular focus on the polyhedral case: We will formalise properly the problem in this setting, state the Cauchy rigidity theorem and give some ideas about its proof. If time permits, I will also state analog questions for spacelike surfaces in Minkowski space. "
